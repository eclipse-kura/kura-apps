/**
 * The {@code CounterPermission} class defines permissions for pulse counter access.

 * A {@code CounterPermission} permission has a target name and a list of actions.
 * <p />
 * The target name contains hardware addressing information. The format is the one defined for the
 * base {@link DevicePermission} class with the following addition:
 * <dl>
 * <dt><code>{channel-desc}</code></dt>
 * <dd>The <code>{channel-desc}</code> string (described in {@code DevicePermission}) is the
 * decimal string representation of a channel number as may be returned by a call to
 * {@code PulseCounterConfig#getChannelNumber}. The characters in the string must all be decimal
 * digits.</dd>
 * </dl>
 * The supported actions are {@code open} and {@code powermanage}. Their meaning is defined as
 * follows:
 * <dl>
 * <dt>{@code open}</dt>
 * <dd>open and access a pulse counter functions (see {@link DeviceManager#open
 * DeviceManager.open})</dd>
 * <dt>{@code powermanage}</dt>
 * <dd>manage the power saving mode of a device (see
