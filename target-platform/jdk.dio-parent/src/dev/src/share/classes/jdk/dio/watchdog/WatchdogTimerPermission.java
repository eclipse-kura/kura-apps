/**
 * The {@code WatchdogTimerPermission} class defines permissions for watchdog timer access.
 * <p />
 * A {@code WatchdogTimerPermission} permission has a target name and a list of actions.
 * <p />
 * The target name contains hardware addressing information. The format is the one defined for the base {@link DevicePermission} class
 * with the following addition:
 * <dl>
 * <dt><code>{channel-desc}</code></dt>
 * <dd>
 * The <code>{channel-desc}</code> string (described in {@link DevicePermission}) is
 * the decimal string representation of a watchdog timer number as may be returned by a call to
 * {@link WatchdogTimerConfig#getTimerNumber WatchdogTimerConfig.getTimerNumber}. The characters in the string must all be decimal digits.
 * </dd>
 * </dl>
 * <p />
 * The supported actions are {@code open} and {@code powermanage}. Their meaning is defined as follows:
 * <dl>
 * <dt>{@code open}</dt>
 * <dd>open and access a watchdog timer functions (see {@link DeviceManager#open DeviceManager.open})</dd>
 * <dt>{@code powermanage}</dt>
 * <dd>manage the power saving mode of a device (see {@link jdk.dio.power.PowerManaged})</dd>
 * </dl>
